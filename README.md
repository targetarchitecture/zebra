# Zebra Robot

Ada loves wall-e, and whilst repeatedly watching the film asked if we could make a wall-e robot. Iâ€™d never made anything that complicated so I looked online to see what others had done. This led me and Ada into the world of the Makers and microprocessors.

Zebra is the name Ada gave her robot after running a competition during her third birthday party.
